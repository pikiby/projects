The task of the project is to make a model for predicting the rating of such hotels.

If the predictions of the model are very different from the actual result, them perhaps. The hotel is playing dishonestly, and it worth checking.

Used libraries:

* optuna - Tool for the selection of hyperparameters;
* plotly.express - for data visualisation;
* textblob - library for processing textual data;
* regular expression - to search for similar expressions;
* numpy - linear algebra;
* sklearn - tool for creating and training a model;
* pandas - data processing.

The model uses RandomForestRegression algorithm.
